## Steps to follow

1. Choose a DateTime handling library such as luxon, date-fns, or moment.js
2. Design the calendar user interface, either following the design in the picture or creating a new design.
3. Implement the functionality to switch between months by adding controls to the UI, such as buttons to move to the next or previous month.
4. Fetch the data for the selected month from the API and display only the dates for that month in the calendar.
5. Show the appropriate data for each day in the day cell of the calendar, possibly limited to a certain number of events.
6. Implement the functionality to determine the current month and year from the URL, such as /2022-05-01.
7. (Optional) Add the ability to show more details about events by clicking on them in the calendar, using the API to fetch additional information.
